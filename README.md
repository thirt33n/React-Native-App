# React-Native-App
This is a static login page made using react native, which lets the user type in username and password(securely without showing up on screen) and has a dummy login button as well.

This was made in expo go, and the page looks like this,

The above image is how the page looks

Typing the password, as shown above only produces black dots instead of alphabets

And finally, taping the login button shows an alert as shown above.


And thats how the app looks for now !
